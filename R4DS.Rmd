### Introduction

![](Introduction.png)

* **Import**: First you must import your data into R.
* **Tidy**: Tidying your data means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with the way it is stored. In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation. 
* **Transform**: Transformation includes narrowing in on observations of interest (like all people in one city, or all data from the last year), creating new variables that are functions of existing variables (like computing speed from distance and time), and calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means).
* **Wrangling**: Together, tidying and transforming are called wrangling, because getting your data in a form thatâ€™s natural to work with often feels like a fight!
* Two main engines of **knowledge generation**:
  + **Visualisation**: is a fundamentally human activity. Does not scale well as it requires a human to interpret.
  + **Modelling**: are complementary tools to visualisation. Works well when the questions are precisely defined. Scales well, as not human involvement.
* **Communication**: Last and the most critical step.
* **Programming**: Cuts across all aspects of the project.

### Importing Packages
```{r packages, results="hide"}
# install.packages(c("tidyverse","nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))
lapply(c("tidyverse","nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"), require, character.only = TRUE)
```
